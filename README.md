# Docker Project for a Node.js Application

This Docker project aims to simplify the deployment and execution process of a Node.js application in a Docker environment. The goal is to provide a clear structure and simple instructions for users to quickly get started with their own Node.js application in a Docker container. While ensuring that the Node.js application runs correctly in the Docker container by accessing it through a browser or using tools like curl or Postman.

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to:

- Provide a ready-to-use Docker configuration for a Node.js application.
- Facilitate the development, testing, and deployment process of the application in a Docker environment.
- Offer a reproducible and portable solution for running the application.

## Instructions

### 1. Building the Docker Image

Navigate to the directory of your Node.js application and execute the following command to build the Docker image:

```sh   
docker build -t my-node-app .
```
### 2. Launching Containers with Docker Compose

Use Docker Compose to launch your application with the following command:
```docker-compose up```

### 3. Testing the Application

Once the containers are launched, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to verify that the application is functioning correctly.

### 4. Project Contents

- Dockerfile: File containing instructions to build the Docker image of the application.
- docker-compose.yml: Docker Compose configuration to launch the application with its dependencies.
- package.json and package-lock.json: Files describing the dependencies and scripts of the Node.js application.
- Other application files: All other necessary files for the Node.js application. (app.js)
